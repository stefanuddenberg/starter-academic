abstract:
  "When we look at a face, we cannot help but 'read' it: beyond simply processing its identity, we\
  \ also form robust impressions of both transient psychological states (e.g. surprise) and stable\
  \ character traits (e.g. trustworthiness).  But perhaps the most fundamental traits we extract from\
  \ faces are their social demographics â€” e.g. race, age, and gender.  How much exposure is\
  \ required to extract such properties?  Curiously, despite extensive work on the temporal\
  \ efficiency of extracting both higher-level social properties (such as competence and dominance)\
  \ and more basic characteristics (such as identity and familiarity), this question remains largely\
  \ unexplored for demography.  We correlated observers' percepts of the race/age/gender of\
  \ unfamiliar faces viewed at several brief durations (and then masked) with their judgments after\
  \ unlimited exposure.  Performance reached asymptote by 100 ms, was above chance by only\
  \ 33.33 ms, and had a similar temporal profile to detecting faces in the first place.  This was true\
  \ even when the property to be reported wasn't revealed until after the face had disappeared, and\
  \ when the faces were matched for several lower-level visual properties.  Collectively, these results\
  \ demonstrate that the extraction of demographic features from faces is highly efficient, and can\
  \ truly be done at a glance."
