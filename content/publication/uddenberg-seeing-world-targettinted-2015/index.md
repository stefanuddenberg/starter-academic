abstract:
  Research shows that positive mood can serve to broaden the scope of attention
  at both the perceptual and conceptual level (e.g., increasing the size of spatial
  attentional focus and semantic access to remote associates). We investigated whether
  this relaxation of attentional filters by positive affect reduces their selectivity
  for basic visual features. We induced positive, neutral, or negative affect and
  asked observers to identify a target motion direction in a series of rapid random
  moving dot displays. Using a reverse correlation method, we examined the differential
  effects of emotion on observers' perceptual tuning curves for motion direction.
  Here we find that positive affect reduces selectivity for motion direction by broadening
  observers' perceptual tuning relative to both neutral and negative affect conditions.
  These findings provide the first behavioral evidence that positive emotion influences
  selectivity for basic visual features through modulation of tuning properties.
