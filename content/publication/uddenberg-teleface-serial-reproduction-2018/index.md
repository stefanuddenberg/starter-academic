abstract:
  "How is race encoded into memory when viewing faces? Here we demonstrate\
  \ a novel systematic bias in which our memories of faces converge on certain prioritized\
  \ regions in our underlying ``face space,'' as they relate to perceived race. This\
  \ convergence was made especially salient using a new visual variant of the method\
  \ of serial reproduction: ``TeleFace.'' A single face was briefly presented, with\
  \ its race selected from a smooth continuum between White and Black (matched for\
  \ mean luminance). The observer then reproduced that face, using a slider to morph\
  \ a test face along this continuum. Their response was then used as the face initially\
  \ presented to the next observer, and so on down the line in each reproduction chain.\
  \ White observers' chains consistently and steadily converged onto faces significantly\
  \ Whiter than they had initially encountered— Whiter than both the original face\
  \ in the chain and the continuum's midpoint— regardless of where chains began. Indeed,\
  \ even chains beginning near the Black end of the continuum inevitably ended up\
  \ well into White space. Very different patterns resulted when the same method was\
  \ applied to other arbitrary face stimuli. These results highlight a systematic\
  \ bias in memory for race in White observers, perhaps contributing to the more general\
  \ notion in social cognition research of a `White default.' (PsycINFO Database Record\
