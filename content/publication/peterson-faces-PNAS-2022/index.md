abstract:
    "The diversity of human faces and the contexts in which they appear gives rise\
    \ to an expansive stimulus space over which people infer psychological traits\
    \ (e.g., trustworthiness or alertness) and other attributes (e.g., age or adiposity).\
    \ Machine learning methods, in particular deep neural networks, provide expressive\
    \ feature representations of face stimuli, but the correspondence between these\
    \ representations and various human attribute inferences is difficult to determine\
    \ because the former are high-dimensional vectors produced via black-box\
    \ optimization algorithms. Here we combine deep generative image models with\
    \ over 1 million judgments to model inferences of more than 30 attributes\
    \ over a comprehensive latent face space. The predictive accuracy of our\
    \ model approaches human interrater reliability, which simulations suggest\
    \ would not have been possible with fewer faces, fewer judgments, or\
    \ lower-dimensional feature representations. Our model can be used to\
    \ predict and manipulate inferences with respect to arbitrary face photographs\
    \ or to generate synthetic photorealistic face stimuli that evoke impressions\
    \ tuned along the modeled attributes."
