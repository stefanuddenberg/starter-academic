abstract:
  Visual processing recovers not only simple features, such as color and shape,
  but also seemingly higher-level properties, such as animacy. Indeed, even abstract
  geometric shapes are readily perceived as intentional agents when they move in certain
  ways, and such percepts can dramatically influence behavior. In the wolfpack effect,
  for example, subjects maneuver a disc around a display in order to avoid several
  randomly moving darts. When the darts point toward the disc, subjects (falsely)
  perceive that the darts are chasing them, and this impairs several types of visuomotor
  performance. Are such effects reflexive, automatic features of visual processing?
  Or might they instead arise only as contingent strategies in tasks in which subjects
  must interact with (and thus focus on the features of) such objects? We explored
  these questions in an especially direct way— by embedding such displays into the
  background of a completely independent ``foraging'' task. Subjects now moved their
  disc to collect small ``food'' dots (which appeared sequentially in random locations)
  as quickly as possible. The darts were task-irrelevant, and subjects were encouraged
  to ignore them. Nevertheless, foraging was impaired when the randomly moving darts
  pointed at the subjects' disc, as compared to control conditions in which they were
  either oriented orthogonally to the subjects' disc or pointed at another moving
  shape— thereby controlling for nonsocial factors. The perception of animacy thus
  influences downstream visuomotor behavior in an automatic manner, such that subjects
  cannot completely override the influences of seemingly animate shapes even while
  attempting to ignore them.
