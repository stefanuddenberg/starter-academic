abstract:
  "Research in person and face perception has broadly focused on group-level consensus\
  \ that individuals hold when making judgments of others (e.g., “X type of face looks trustworthy”).\
  \ However, a growing body of research demonstrates that individual variation is larger than shared,\
  \ stimulus-level variation for many social trait judgments. Despite this insight, little research\
  \ to date has focused on building and explaining individual models of face perception.\
  \ Studies and methodologies that have examined individual models are limited in what\
  \ visualizations they can reliably produce to either noisy and blurry or computer avatar\
  \ representations. Methods that produce low-fidelity visual representations inhibit\
  \ generalizability by being clearly computer manipulated and produced. In the present work,\
  \ we introduce a novel paradigm to visualize individual models of face judgments by leveraging\
  \ state-of-the-art computer vision methods. Our proposed method can produce a set of photorealistic\
  \ face images that correspond to an individual's mental representation of a specific attribute\
  \ across a variety of attribute intensities. We provide a proof-of-concept study which examines\
  \ perceived trustworthiness/untrustworthiness and masculinity/femininity. We close with a\
  \ discussion of future work to substantiate our proposed method."
