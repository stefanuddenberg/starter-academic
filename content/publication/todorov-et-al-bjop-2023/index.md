abstract:
  "In their comprehensive review of research on impressions\
  \ from faces, Sutherland and Young (this issue) highlight both\
  \ the remarkable progress and the many challenges facing the\
  \ field. We focus on two of the challenges: the need for generative,\
  \ powerful models of impressions and the idiosyncratic\
  \ nature of complex impressions."
