abstract:
  Paranoia is the belief that harm is intended by others. It may arise from
  selective pressures to infer and avoid social threats, particularly in ambiguous
  or changing circumstances. We propose that uncertainty may be sufficient to elicit
  learning differences in paranoid individuals, without social threat. We used reversal
  learning behavior and computational modeling to estimate belief updating across
  individuals with and without mental illness, online participants, and rats chronically
  exposed to methamphetamine, an elicitor of paranoia in humans. Paranoia is associated
  with a stronger prior on volatility, accompanied by elevated sensitivity to perceived
  changes in the task environment. Methamphetamine exposure in rats recapitulates
  this impaired uncertainty-driven belief updating and rigid anticipation of a volatile
  environment. Our work provides evidence of fundamental, domain-general learning
  differences in paranoid individuals. This paradigm enables further assessment of
  the interplay between uncertainty and belief-updating across individuals and species.
