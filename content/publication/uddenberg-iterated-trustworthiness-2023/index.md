abstract:
  "When we look at someone's face, we rapidly and automatically form robust impressions of how\
  \ trustworthy they appear. Yet while people's impressions of trustworthiness show a high degree\
  \ of reliability and agreement with one another, evidence for the accuracy of these impressions\
  \ is weak. How do such appearance-based biases survive in the face of weak evidence? We\
  \ explored this question using an iterated learning paradigm, in which memories relating\
  \ (perceived) facial and behavioral trustworthiness were passed through many generations of participants.\
  \ Stimuli consisted of pairs of computer-generated people's faces and exact dollar amounts\
  \ that those fictional people shared with partners in a trust game. Importantly, the faces were\
  \ designed to vary considerably along a dimension of perceived facial trustworthiness. Each participant\
  \ learned (and then reproduced from memory) some mapping between the faces and the dollar\
  \ amounts shared (i.e., between perceived facial and behavioral trustworthiness). Much like in the game\
  \ of 'telephone', their reproductions then became the training stimuli initially presented to the\
  \ next participant, and so on for each transmission chain. Critically, the first participant in\
  \ each chain observed some mapping between perceived facial and behavioral trustworthiness, including\
  \ positive linear, negative linear, nonlinear, and completely random relationships. Strikingly,\
  \ participants' reproductions of these relationships showed a pattern of convergence in which\
  \ more trustworthy looks were associated with more trustworthy behavior â€” even when\
  \ there was no relationship between looks and behavior at the start of the chain. These results\
  \ demonstrate the power of facial stereotypes, and the ease with which they can be propagated to\
  \ others, even in the absence of any reliable origin of these stereotypes."
