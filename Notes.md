# Notes
- `hugo server` to debug
- `hugo mod clean` if weird errors before allowing debug
- hide/show sections with `active = false` or `active = true` in the header of the `section.md` file
- change order of sections with `weight = XXX` -- higher numbers come later. This is done in `config.toml`, `menus.toml`, and the individual `index.md` files
